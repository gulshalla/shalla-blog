shalla-blog
===========

This repository contains a basic blog built using Python3 and Flask.
It is a work in progress.

The app is deployed on Heroku. You can check it out here:
```

```

Since it is a free dyno, the server sleeps every 30 minutes. Currently, the database is reinitialized every time the app is restarted.
